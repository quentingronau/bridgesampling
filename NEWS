                    Changes in bridgesampling Version 0.4-x
                    Released December 2017

  Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

  o More informative error messages for methods due to checking of input values:
    - bridge_sampler() methods now check lb and ub.
    - bf() methods check class of x2.
    - post_prob() checks if only one object of appropriate class is passed.
    
  o Promoted error_measures() to generic function with methods for both 
    repetitions = 1 and repetitions > 1. In the latter case median and IQR are 
    reported. The only situation where we can not report error measures is if
    repetitions = 1 and method = "warp3".
    
  o Added summary() (and corresponding print.summary) methods for bridge and 
    bridge_list objects. These methods now always invoke error_measures() and 
    return a data.frame with both log marginal likelihood and error information. 
    These methods are described in ?`bridge-methods`.
    
  o Updated bridgesampling vignette to latest version.

  Bugfixes

  o Retroactively updated the NEWS file.

                    Changes in bridgesampling Version 0.3-x
                    Released October 2017

  Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

  o Added a variety of new methods for bridge_sampler() that automatically
    extract the posterior samples, but also require a log_posterior function.
    Specifically, bridge_sampler() now has methods of this kind for the
    following objects: matrix, mcmc.list, rjags, and runjags.

  o Added stanreg method to bridge_sampler() which allows to pass objects from
    rstanarm. Note that this method requires to specify the diagnostic_file
    option, see examples. Thanks to Ben Goodrich for the pull request.

  o Added new vignette introducing the package: bridgesampling: An R Package
    for Estimating Normalizing Constants

  o Added two new data sets plus code used in the new vignette, see ?ier and
    ?turtles

  o Added bayes_factor() as alias for bf(), as bf() is an existing function in
    package brms.

  o Added use_neff argument to bridge_sampler() which allows to determine
    whether the effective sample size or the actual sample size is used for
    bridge sampling.

  Bugfixes

  o bridge_sampler() for stan objects on windows should not fail anymore if
    cores > 1. Instead, cores will be set to 1 (with warnings).

                       ** bridgesampling VERSION 0.2-x **
                       ***********************************

                    Changes in bridgesampling Version 0.2-x
                    Released June 2017

  Significant User Visible Changes and New Features

  o Added stan_bridge_sampler(), which allows one to obtain the marginal
    likelihood directly from a fitted stanfit object that contains posterior
    samples. Note that it may be necessary to compile a new stanfit object
    without samples if the one with samples was compiled in a different
    session/pc. See new vignettes for examples.

  o Added repetitions argument to bridge sampler functions which allows to
    compute independent bridge sample estimates (based on the same posterior
    samples). bridge_sampler() now returns object of class "bridge" for
    calculations with repetitions = 1, but an object of class "bridge_list" if
    repetitions > 1, the latter contains the full list of estimates (but no q
    vectors).

  o Renamed compute_post_prob() to post_prob(), which is now a generic function
    with methods for bridge objects. The default method allows just logml
    values. For "bridge_list" objects (i.e., with repetitions > 1) a matrix of
    posterior probabilities with rows for each repetition is returned.

  o added new generic function logml() which returns the log marginal likelihood
    as a scalar value.

  o Multicore computations (i.e., cors > 1) on Unix-like systen (e.g., Mac OS,
    Linux) are now performed with forking via parallel::mcapply().

  Bugfixes

  o compute_post_prob() now works even when exp(logml) initially returns Inf
    (solution works via brobdingnag).

  o Bridge sampler more robust due to various small improvements and produces
    more informative error messages should it fail.

  o If log_prob() returns NA, these values are replaced with -Inf on the log
    scale (which assumes a likelihood of 0). With warning.
